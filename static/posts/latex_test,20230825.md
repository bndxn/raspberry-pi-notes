$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
$$


This is an inline equation $$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$. 

Consider a task where you have some input data $$X$$, and your task is to predict the output $$y$$. This idea of a linear relationship between variables is found in many fields. 

\[y = wx + b\]

A more general form of this is where you can take in multiple inputs, $$x_1, x_2, etc $$. We can use the same approach to find the relationship between multiple input variables and an output variable. 

In linear regression, we work out the weights $$ w^{1}, w^{2}, etc, w^{n} $$ in the equation $$y = x\_1w\_1 + x\_2w\_2 + ... + b$$

You may remember from school doing something like: 

\[S_{xy} = \sum{xy} - \frac{\sum{x}\sum{y}}{n}\]

\[S_{xx} = \sum{x^2} - \frac{(\sum{x})^2}{n}\]

Then to find the coefficients in our $$y = wx + ... + b$$, we get $$a^2 + w\_1 + b^2 = c^2$$ out our calculators and do something like this:
\[w=S\_{xx}/S\_{xy}\]
\[b=\bar{y} - w\bar{x}\]

Here is one underscore _ that was one. 

And now with an escape \_ that's another.
