Anyone who's spent time working with code, or any document really, will know that version control is not some fusty detail. Good version control is central to developing top-quality products. 

As a new data scientist, there are a few key ideas to keep in mind that will help a lot. The first one to pick up here is understanding **branching**. 

1. Git sets up local branches to track remote branches.

2. Branches can be easily merged with another, and merge conflicts resolved in-line.

3. Rebasing allows you to apply diffs (changes) made on one branch, to another branch.
