# Notes on a weather station idea

Three general areas of this repo: 

* Collecting data (takes USB readings, plus uploads them to S3) - currently a Python file, should in future be a cronjob
* Generating docker container for website using Flask and Plotly, hosted on AWS Lightsail
* Misc potentially useful code from various places
