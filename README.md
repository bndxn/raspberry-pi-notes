Components
* RasPi and TemperHUM collecting temp and humidity readings
* DynamoDB bucket storing readings
* Flask application generating Plotly graphs, running on EC2 using Elastic Beanstalk, available at `pi.bendixon.net`.
* Deployment uses EB CLI: actuivate virtual env with `source eb-env/bin/activate`, then can test with `docker run -8080:8080 -v ~/.aws/credentials:/root/.aws/credentials docker_eb_v1`. Then can deploy with `eb deploy` from inside the directory.
